XUI
===

A lightweight, dead simple, microtiny, super modular JavaScript framework for building mobile web applications.


### XUI Application Authors and Hackers

Its true: the minified code is _super tiny_. You can find more information, downloads and documentation at http://xuijs.com ---if you want to build your own custom XUI or help contribute: please read on!

### XUI Contributors and Hackers

To get the full source you need to use Git. _git clone_ the repo (as per usual) and then pull in the dependencies via _git submodule init_ and _git submodule update_. To build xui: run _rake_ in the shell of your choice from the root of the project directory. (This requires Ruby.) There are other tasks for code minification, running the specs and generating docs. Run `rake -T` to see them all.
